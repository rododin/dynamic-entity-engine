<h1>Dynamic Entity Engine - Overview</h1>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p/>
  Do you know about the "Heroes of Might and Magic" game, or probably about "Civilization"?
  Or about another game with lots of different units like Dragons, Knights, Archers,
  or maybe Tanks, Super-sonic Fighters and Missile Cruisers?
  Or probably you have a business application with dozens of different business entities
  your business logic works with?
  <p/>
  If you have to develop something like this, how would you like to act?
  Would you manually create dozens or hundreds of appropriate classes with dozens of getters/setters inside
  just to describe all your entities? Of course you are an familiar OO-developer and you will build
  a well organized hierarchy of the entities (or game units). And if your entities must be stored persistently,
  of course, you will map them onto the relational tables using JPA-annotations. And then you will write
  tones of the business logic (dozens of session beans) to manage and process somehow all of these
  plain entities - the entities just consisting of sets of properties defined using simple getter/setter methods.
  <p/>
  What would you do if your business logic must intercept events like <code>propertyChanged</code>
  or <code>propertyAccessed</code>? You have, for instance, 50-60 different entities with about of 10
  properties per entity on average. And you need to intercept different events like <code>propertyChanged</code>
  or <code>entitySaved</code> sometimes only. Would you add an <i>event listener</i> support into the each
  getter/setter method where it is required? Or would you add the <i>listener</i> support into all
  getters/setters just because you don't know when and where it could be required?
  <p/>
  And again about the well-organized classical object-oriented hierarchy...
  E.g., all your entities have the property <code>id</code> playing the primary key role.
  Mostly this <code>id</code> is an <code>Integer</code>, but in a few cases it is a <code>String</code>.
  Many of your entities have the property <code>name</code>, e.g. <code>User</code>, or <code>Client</code>,
  or <code>Organization</code>. <code>User</code> and <code>Client</code> are people, so,
  you may describe their common properties
  (<code>name</code>, <code>Surname</code>, <code>birthDate</code>, <code>taxNumber</code>, etc.)
  in the <code>Person</code> class. The <code>name</code> property must go into the abstract
  <code>NamedEntity</code> class, because <code>Organization</code> has this property too.
  But <code>taxNumber</code> is applicable for <code>Client</code>s only, so it must go into the
  <code>Client</code> class. However an <code>Organization</code> may also play the <code>Client</code> role,
  so the <code>Client</code> is not a <code>Person</code>, it is just an abstract <code>Client</code>
  extended by <code>ClientPerson</code> and <code>ClientOrganization</code> classes. In such situation
  the <code>ClientPerson</code> must extend two classes: <code>Person</code> and <code>Client</code>.
  And similar the <code>ClientOrganization</code> must extend
  <code>Organization</code> and <code>Client</code>.
  In Java you have no multiple inheritance and interfaces are not working because these properties must be
  marked with JPA-annotations. Any case, even if it would be possible to work with multiple interfaces,
  you have to duplicate the code implementing the same properties and/or you have to
  aggregate single implementations and duplicate the code accessing these aggregated implementations.
  In other words, the aggregation of implementations is also a code duplication.
  <p/>
  I hope, that's enough to ask you, would you really like to do all of this routine and repeatable work?
  Would you really like to write manually dozens of classes with hundreds of properties?
  Would you like to think over the listener support and well organized hierarchies?
  Or just would you like to do a lot of repeatable work?
  <p/>
  I hope you need a pragmatic and optimal implementation of your task with a minimum of duplicated code
  and minimum of the routine and repeatable work from your side. If so, let me to ask you,
  do you really need the exact relational mapping between a business model entity and Java class?
  If no, let me to propose the solution implemented in this package and its sub-packages.

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  The idea of the solution is based on the meta-view of the system. Each entity is just an entity,
  and each entity property is just a property. So, everything you need is just the <code>Property</code>
  class for definition of any named property, and the <code>Entity</code> class for defining a named entity
  with a set of child properties.
  <p/>
  So, each <code>Property</code> has a <code>name</code> and a <code>value</code>. Of course it would be nice
  to extend the <code>Property</code> with a <code>valueClass</code> definition and <code>defaultValue</code>.
  Further extension may include a support for <code>PropertyListener</code> and any other things you would need.
  <p/>
  Similar, each <code>Entity</code> has at least a <code>name</code> and a set of child <code>Properties</code>.
  Further you may extend it with an <code>EntityListener</code> and other things.
  <p/>
  Of course, you may say, such solution is not optimal, because each <code>Property</code>
  except the <code>value</code> must also store its <code>name</code>, its <code>defaultValue</code>, etc.
  And the same is with the <code>Entity</code> - each <code>Entity</code> must know its <code>name</code>
  and what's else. So, e.g. if we will have just a thouthand of different instances of the <code>Ware</code>
  entity, our <code>Entity</code> class will store the name "Ware" thouthand times.
  Each of these thouthand instances will have, e.g., three properties (<code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and
  <code>price</code>). So, these three strings ("id", "name" and "price") will be stored each for 1000 times too.
  The same is for <code>defaultValue</code>, etc.
  <p/>
  To avoid such situation we introduce the <code>PropertyDescriptor</code> and <code>EntityDescriptor</code>
  appropriately. These classes include any common information about the properties and entities appropriately
  (<code>name</code>, <code>valueClass</code>, <code>defaultValue</code>, etc.).
  So, each <code>Property</code> and <code>Entity</code> must know just about their descriptors.
  It is just a single reference per object.
  It is also possible to avoid duplication of descriptors themselves. Internal mechanism stores the descriptors
  in internal maps and if create a new property (even for another entity) with the same common attributes,
  the existing descriptor will be used. All of this is done transparently for the end-developer (for you).
  <p/>
  Please note, the current implementation doesn't support listeners or other extended features.
  It just demonstrates the idea.
  <p/>
  The package <code>ru.rododin.dynamic_entity.unit</code> contains a simple example implementation
  based on this idea. The example introduces a few <code>Unit</code>s defined by the
  <code>UnitDefinition</code> enumeration. Of course, it is very easy to develop another implementation
  where the units will be specified just using a <code>.properties</code> file or using an XML-configuration
  file.
